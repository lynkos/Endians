Endian Converter
=======
This is the first project I've uploaded onto here, so obviously it's not going to be that great,
and it took me about an hour to think up and type.

But the purpose and concept really is quite simple: A JPanel pops up and the user inputs hexadecimal/bytes,
chooses whether they want it to be converted to Little-Endian or Big-Endian, and voil√†! The result is given
in a separate JPanel (which also allows them to copy the result).

But if you happen to spot any bugs or issues, feel free to let me know. (:
